CosmoScout uses C++17 and OpenGL. It can be build on Linux (gcc or clang) and Windows (msvc). Nearly all dependencies are included as [git submodules](externals), please refer to the section [Build Instructions](#build-instructions) in order to get started.

We try to add as many comments to the source code as possible. The number of source code lines and comment lines above is computed with the script [cloc.sh](cloc.sh). This script only counts *real comments*. Any dumb comments (such as copy-right headers or stuff like `/////////`) are not included in this number.

# Features

**CosmoScout VR is research software which is still under heavy development and changes on a daily basis. Many features are badly documented, it will crash without warning and may do other unexpected things. We are working hard on improving the user experience - please [report all issues and suggestions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/issues) you have!**

## Plugins for CosmoScout VR

CosmoScout VR can be extended via plugins. In fact, without any plugins, CosmoScout VR is just a black and empty universe. Here is a list of available plugins.

Official Plugins | Description | Screenshot
:----|:-----------------|:----------
[csp-anchor-labels](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-anchor-labels) | Draws a click-able label at each celestial anchor. When activated, the user automatically travels to the according body. The size and overlapping-behavior of the labels can be adjusted. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-anchor-labels.jpg)
[csp-atmospheres](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-atmospheres) | Draws atmospheres around celestial bodies. It calculates single Mie- and Rayleigh scattering via raycasting in real-time. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-atmospheres.jpg)
[csp-fly-to-locations](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-fly-to-locations) | Adds several quick travel targets to the sidebar. It supports shortcuts to celestial bodies and to specific geographic locations on those bodies. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-fly-to-locations.jpg)
[csp-lod-bodies](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-lod-bodies) | Draws level-of-detail planets and moons. This plugin supports the visualization of entire planets in a 1:1 scale. The data is streamed via Web-Map-Services (WMS) over the internet. A dedicated MapServer is required to use this plugin. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-lod-bodies.jpg)
[csp-measurement-tools](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-measurement-tools) | Provides several tools for terrain measurements. For example, it supports the measurement of distances, height profiles, volumes or areas. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-measurement-tools.jpg)
[csp-rings](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-rings) |  Draws simple rings around celestial bodies. The rings can be configured with a inner and a outer radius and a texture. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-rings.jpg)
[csp-satellites](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-satellites) | Draws GTLF models at positions based on SPICE data. It uses physically based rendering for surface shading. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-satellites.jpg)
[csp-sharad](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-sharad) | Renders radar datasets acquired by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The SHARAD profiles are rendered inside of Mars, the Martian surface is made translucent in front of the profiles. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-sharad.jpg)
[csp-simple-bodies](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-simple-bodies) | Renders simple spherical celestial bodies. The bodies are drawn as an ellipsoid with an equirectangular texture. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-simple-bodies.jpg)
[csp-stars](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-stars) | Draws 3D-stars loaded from catalogues. For now, it supports the Tycho, the Tycho2 and the Hipparcos catalogue. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-stars.jpg)
[csp-trajectories](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-trajectories) | Draws trajectories of celestial bodies and spacecrafts based on SPICE. The color, length, number of samples and reference frame can be configured. | ![screenshot](resources/screenshots/csp-trajectories.jpg)

## Build Instructions

CosmoScout VR can be build in debug and release mode on Linux and Windows. Most dependencies are included as [git submodules](externals). **You will only need a copy of [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.12 or greater), [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (version 1.69 or greater) and a recent C++ compiler (gcc 8, clang 5 or msvc 19). For the compilation of the externals [Python](https://www.python.org/) is also required.**

### Linux

On Linux, one can either use the provided shell scripts ([make_release.sh](make_release.sh) and [make_debug.sh](make_debug.sh)) or build the software manually using CMake. **Using the provided scripts** is easy and definitely the recommended way.

In any way, first you have to compile the dependencies. This step only has to be done once.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr.git
cd cosmoscout-vr
git submodule update --init
./make_externals.sh
```

This will clone the repository to `cosmoscout-vr` configure and build all externals in `cosmoscout-vr/build/linux-externals` and will install them to `cosmoscout-vr/install/linux-externals`. For a minimal setup you will need some data sets which are not included in this git repository. Run this script to download the data to `cosmoscout-vr/data`:

```shell
./get_example_data.sh
```

Now you can compile CosmoScout VR:

```shell
./make_release.sh
```

This will configure and build CosmoScout VR in `cosmoscout-vr/build/linux-release` and will install it to `cosmoscout-vr/install/linux-release`. The application can be executed with:

```shell
cd install/linux-release/bin
./start.sh
```

If you wich, you can delete the directories `build` and `install` at any time in order to force a complete reconfiguration or re-installation.

For **manual compilation** follow the steps outlined in [make_release.sh](make_release.sh) or [make_debug.sh](make_debug.sh).

### Windows

For Windows, there are batch scripts ([make_release.bat](make_release.bat) and [make_debug.bat](make_debug.bat)) which can be used in the same way as the scripts for Linux:

First you have to compile the dependencies. This step only has to be done once. Run the commands below from the Visual Studio Developer Command Line:

```batch
git clone git@github.com:cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr.git
cd cosmoscout-vr
git submodule update --init
make_externals.bat
```

This will clone the repository to `cosmoscout-vr` configure and build all externals in `cosmoscout-vr\build\windows-externals` and will install them to `cosmoscout-vr\install\windows-externals`. For a minimal setup you will need some data sets which are not included in this git repository. Run this script to download the data to `cosmoscout-vr\data`:

```batch
get_example_data.bat
```

Now you can compile CosmoScout VR. On Linux, boost is usually found automatically by CMake, on Windows you have to provide the `BOOST_ROOT` path. **Replace the path in the command below to match your setup!**

```batch
set BOOST_ROOT=C:\local\boost_1_69_0
make_release.bat
```

This will configure and build CosmoScout VR in `cosmoscout-vr\build\windows-release` and will install it to `cosmoscout-vr\install\windows-release`. The application can be executed with:

```batch
cd install\windows-release\bin
start.bat
```

If you wich, you can delete the directories `build` and `install` at any time in order to force a complete reconfiguration or re-installation.

## Using the application

**Navigation:** There are several ways for interacting with the planet. Currently mouse, keyboard and space navigator are supported. More input devices can be added via VRPN. The mouse navigation is still in development - while it is already quite useful, the user experience may be improved.

<p align="center"> 
  <img src ="resources/mouse_controls.svg" />
</p>

**Keyboard Shortcuts:** The most important one is `Alt-Enter` which will toggle full-screen mode. `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` will move the virtual camera; `Q` and `E` can be used to control the roll; `R` and `F` can be used to control the altitude. All other shortcuts can be shown by pressing `?`. They will be printed to the console window.</p>

**User Interface:** When you start CosmoScout VR, you will see several user interface elements. The top bar shows information regarding your current camera position, the position of the mouse pointer on the planets surface and the current simulation time (UTC). In addition, there are some buttons controlling the simulation time.

On the left hand side is the main menu. Here you can select which datasets are shown, manipulate the surface visualization, add annotations, fly to pre-defined locations and perform various other tasks.

**More in-depth information and some tutorials will be provided soon.**
