CosmoScout VR is a modular virtual universe developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).
It lets you explore, analyze and present huge planetary data sets and large simulation data in real-time.

Nearly all dependencies are included as [git submodules](externals), please refer to the [**documentation**](docs) in order to get started.

# Features

<p align="center">

</p>

Below is a rough sketch of the possibilities you have with CosmoScout VR.
While this list is far from complete it provides a good overview of the current feature set.
You can also read the [**changelog**](docs/changelog.md) to learn what's new in the current version. There is also an [**interesting article in the DLR magazine**](https://dlr.de/dlr/portaldata/1/resources/documents/dlr_magazin_161_EN/DLR-Magazin_161-GB/?page=18) which provides some insight into the ideas behind CosmoScout VR.

# Getting Started

</p>

:warning: _**Warning:** CosmoScout VR is research software which is still under heavy development and changes on a daily basis.
Many features are badly documented, it will crash without warning and may do other unexpected things.
We are working hard on improving the user experience - please [report all issues and suggestions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/issues) you have!_

For each release, [binary packages](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/releases) are automatically created via [Github Actions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/actions).

When started for the very first time, some example datasets will be downloaded from the internet.
**This will take some time!**
The progress of this operation is shown on the loading screen.


If the binary releases do not work for you or you want to test the latest features, you have to compile CosmoScout VR yourself.
This is actually quite easy as there are several guides in the **[`docs`](docs)** directory to get you started!

# Plugins for CosmoScout VR

CosmoScout VR can be extended via plugins.
In fact, without any plugins, CosmoScout VR is just a black and empty universe. Here is a list of available plugins.

Official Plugins | Description | Screenshot
:----|:-----------------|:----------
[csp-anchor-labels](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-anchor-labels) | Draws a click-able label at each celestial anchor. When activated, the user automatically travels to the selected body. The size and overlapping-behavior of the labels can be adjusted. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-anchor-labels.jpg)
[csp-atmospheres](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-atmospheres) | Draws atmospheres around celestial bodies. It calculates single Mie- and Rayleigh scattering via raycasting in real-time. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-atmospheres.jpg)
[csp-fly-to-locations](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-fly-to-locations) | Adds several quick travel targets to the sidebar. It supports shortcuts to celestial bodies and to specific geographic locations on those bodies. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-fly-to-locations.jpg)
[csp-lod-bodies](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-lod-bodies) | Draws level-of-detail planets and moons. This plugin supports the visualization of entire planets in a 1:1 scale. The data is streamed via Web-Map-Services (WMS) over the internet. A dedicated MapServer is required to use this plugin. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-lod-bodies.jpg)
[csp-measurement-tools](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-measurement-tools) | Provides several tools for terrain measurements. Like measurement of distances, height profiles, volumes or areas. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-measurement-tools.jpg)
[csp-rings](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-rings) |  Draws simple rings around celestial bodies. The rings can be configured with an inner and an outer radius and a texture. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-rings.jpg)
[csp-satellites](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-satellites) | Draws GTLF models at positions based on SPICE data. It uses physically based rendering for surface shading. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-satellites.jpg)
[csp-sharad](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-sharad) | Renders radar datasets acquired by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The SHARAD profiles are rendered inside of Mars, the Martian surface is made translucent in front of the profiles. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-sharad.jpg)
[csp-simple-bodies](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-simple-bodies) | Renders simple spherical celestial bodies. The bodies are drawn as an ellipsoid with an equirectangular texture. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-simple-bodies.jpg)
[csp-stars](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-stars) | Draws 3D-stars loaded from catalogues. For now Tycho, Tycho2 and the Hipparcos catalogue are supported. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-stars.jpg)
[csp-trajectories](https://github.com/cosmoscout/csp-trajectories) | Draws trajectories of celestial bodies and spacecrafts based on SPICE. The color, length, number of samples and the reference frame can be configured. | ![screenshot](docs/img/csp-trajectories.jpg)
