# Precomputation of Multiple-Scattering Textures

The `bruneton-preprocessor` command-line tool precomputes the multiple scattering lookup tables for the `Bruneton` atmosphere model.
It consumes the CSV files generated by the `scattering-table-generator` tool and stores the resulting textures in the specified directory.

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> Per default, the atmosphere preprocessor is not built. To build it, you need to pass `-DCSP_ATMOSPHERES_PREPROCESSOR=On` in the make script.

The preprocessor assumes to be executed in the root of the `cosmoscout-vr` repository.
You'll need to set the library search path to contain the `install/<os>-<build_type>/lib` directory.
This depends on where the `bruneton-preprocessor` is installed to, but this may be something like this:

```bash
# For Windows (powershell)
cd cosmoscout-vr
$env:Path += ";install\windows-Release\lib"

# For Linux (bash)
cd cosmoscout-vr
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=install/linux-Release/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

You can then execute the preprocessor with the following command:

```bash
# For Windows (powershell)
install\windows-Release\bin\bruneton-preprocessor <settings.json> <output directory>

# For Linux (bash)
install/linux-Release/bin/bruneton-preprocessor <settings.json> <output directory>
```

For instance, the currently used lookup tables were generated with the following command:

```bash
cd cosmoscout-vr
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=install/linux-Release/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
install/linux-Release/bin/bruneton-preprocessor plugins/csp-atmospheres/bruneton-preprocessor/settings/earth.json plugins/csp-atmospheres/bruneton-preprocessor/output/earth
install/linux-Release/bin/bruneton-preprocessor plugins/csp-atmospheres/bruneton-preprocessor/settings/mars.json plugins/csp-atmospheres/bruneton-preprocessor/output/mars
```

### Configuration Files

The settings file is a JSON file that specifies the parameters for the precomputation.
You can see some example files in the [`settings`](settings) directory.
