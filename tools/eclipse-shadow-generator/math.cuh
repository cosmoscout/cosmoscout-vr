// that the radius of the Solar disc is 1.0. This is usually sufficient for computing the visible
// fraction of the Sun.
// To get the actual angular radii and angular distances, more information on the involved geometry
// is needed. For this, use the function below.

// To reconstruct the actual geometry of the involved bodies for a given location in the shadow map,
// we need additional information like the real-world radii of the Sun and the occluder, as well as
// their distance to each other.
//
// It happens that this reconstruction is a non-trivial problem which cannot be solved analytically.
// Even if there is only a single solution, it seems to be impossible to find it without numerical
// methods.
//
// For pixels with a x-coordinate close to zero, it may be impossible to find a solution. As the
// orbit radius is fixed, the Sun's maximum angular radius is fixed as well. Therefore, depending on
// on the occluder's radius, there may be no solution. In this case, the function returns 0.
//
// Our approach is as follow:
//  1. The largest possible angular radius of the Sun from any position in the occluder's shadow
//     is its angular radius when observed from the occluder's position. Therefore, we scale all
//     values returned by mapPixelToRadii this value. Most likely, the Sun will appear even smaller
//     as our searched point is further away from the occluder, but we take this as an initial
//     guess.
//  2. We now use the real radius of the occluder, the average distance between Sun and occluder,
//     and the angular distance between the centers of Sun and occluder to compute the resulting
//     distance to the Sun from the searched point. This will be farther away than the initial
//     guess.
//  3. Using the real radius of the Sun, we can now compute again how large the Sun will appear
//     from the searched point. This will be smaller than the initial guess. We again scale all
//     angles to this value and repeat the process until we converge.
//
// The method returns the number of iterations needed to converge.
